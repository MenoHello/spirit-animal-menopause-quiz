Enter your Fox era: a master of poise with a body that treats temperature like a roulette wheel. One moment you’re cool and collected, the next you're clawing at layers like they personally betrayed you. Sharp-witted and always adapting, you’ve perfected the art of the graceful meltdown. Sly, smoldering, and slightly steamed—you’re a walking contradiction in lip gloss and a cooling towel."

Occasionally spotted, but never caught. You’re in your Bobcat era. Wildly intelligent but prone to sudden vanishing acts. You roam the mental wilderness with flashes of brilliance followed by—wait, what were we talking about again? You're agile, intuitive, and always circling back… eventually."

Welcome to your Monkey era—where feelings fly fast, free, and completely unfiltered. You swing through the emotional jungle with zero apologies and maximum authenticity. From tree-top joy to ground-level grump in under a minute? That’s not instability—it’s emotional range.

You glide through midlife at your own pace—with snacks in hand and zero guilt about canceling plans. Graceful in slow motion, majestic in stretchy pants, and completely unbothered by hustle culture. Resting is your cardio—and honestly, it’s iconic."

It’s not that you don’t like people… okay, maybe it is. But under that prickly exterior? A heart of gold—just don’t make any sudden movements."
